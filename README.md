# Why Morally Gray Characters Are the Best 

To start off, let me define a morally gray character: a character that is hard to put into either category of good or evil, or "the villains with a point, the heroes who will cross the line, the ones who will make the difficult decisions" (From [InHouse Publishing](https://www.inhousepublishing.com.au/how-to-write-a-morally-grey-character/#:~:text=So%2C%20what%20makes%20a%20morally,the%20ones%20shrouded%20in%20controversy.))
Here are some popular examples:

### Now that you have some examples, I'll explain why they are <i> the </i> best characters:

Morally gray characters are appealing because they represent most real people. It makes the character seem more realistic and sketched-out instead of a hero whose only personality trait is to save civilians and put the bad guys in jail. Don't you find yourself frustrated when a hero continuously fights the same villain and defeats them, yet they can't seem to finish them off? Yeah, I hate those characters too.
